       <p>This is Lionel "Ploum" Dricot <a href='https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-ploum'>writing</a> about his blog on <a 	href='https://peopleandblogs.com/'>People and Blogs</a> with Manu Moreale:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>My blog is exactly where I want it to be. If I had to start again, I would simply do it like I did in 2022. I was quick to remove any form of comments from my blog and, later, any kind of statistics. As far as I know, I’m one of the few strong advocates for the complete removal of statistics/analytic/tracking tools. It’s not ethical to spy on users but it is also completely counterproductive. Statistics on websites are a brainworm. People are obsessed by it and it makes them write dumb stuff in order to increase a dumb counter. Getting rid of any audience-measuring tool is one of the best things I did in 2013.</p>

		<blockquote>
		<p>I’ve completely deleted all my social network accounts and never felt so free. Ironically, the less I was using social networks, the more readers I had on my blog. Social networks don’t bring you an audience. This is a lie! Social networks distract you from your real work and prevent your audience from reaching you. That’s their whole business! I know how frightening it is to delete permanently an account with thousands of followers. But this number is also a lie.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>This quote has prompted me to rethink my approach to this blog. While I’ve always valued the freedom to write what I want, the reminder to eliminate distractions like analytics and social media has hit home.</p>
		<p>I've turned off analytics to focus more on the writing. I've also eliminated social media letting my blog stand on its own merits. This feels like a step toward a better connection with my work and readers.</p>
