        <p>Hey friends, we all have to write our blog posts in a text editor app or a word processor. I prefer to write mine in a Markdown text editor. I also like simple and minimal. One editor I have been favoring lately is <a href='https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit'>MarkEdit</a> which is Mac only. I <a href='https://thejollyteapot.com/2023/10/29/i-have-found-my-favourite-markdown-editor-again'>discovered MarkEdit</a> reading Nicolas Magand’s blog <a href='https://thejollyteapot.com/'>The Jolly TeaPot</a>. By the way, if you aren’t following his blog you should.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>This app is quite something. It was one of the first apps I tried, and I think my senses were still a bit dormant. At first, I wasn’t amazed by it; I just thought, “Well, this is pretty good”, and I moved on to the next app.</p>
        <p>But after reviewing all the other apps and gaining some experience at judging quickly if one suits my needs or not, I decided to give a second chance to a few of them. And MarkEdit turned out to be the one.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The apps that I’ve used in the past are Drafts, Ulysses, and iA Writer. I’ve been on and off of Ulysses over the years but at the end of the day, I don’t like the shitty way that it handles markdown so it is no longer an option. There is something about iA Writer but I can’t put my finger on why it never worked for me. I use Drafts for more than just writing. It’s my capture app and where I write quick-short text items like email etc.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for a great Markdown editor for your Mac, check out MarkEdit. It’s free, open-source, and feels just like TextEdit but built specifically for Markdown. Privacy-friendly too—no data collection at all. It’s lightweight (only about 3 MB), really fast (can handle big files up to 10 MB easily), and integrates smoothly with Shortcuts. Worth a try if you want something simple and intuitive for your Markdown needs.</p>
