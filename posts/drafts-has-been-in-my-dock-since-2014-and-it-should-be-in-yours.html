        <p>Hey friends, I first installed <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> back in 2014, when it was on version 3 and still just iOS only. From that moment, it’s never left my iPhone Dock. Then, when Drafts for Mac dropped in 2019, it went straight to my Mac’s dock, too.</p>
        <p>Here’s the thing: I’ve tried a ton of apps over the years, and nothing even comes close to replacing Drafts. It’s where every bit of text starts. Blog ideas, random thoughts, notes, you name it. If you aren’t using it, you’re seriously missing out. And yeah, the free version is more than enough to get you hooked.</p>
        <p>Here’s how I use Drafts:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Quick capture: Got an idea? A thought? Drafts is open, and it’s saved.</li>
			<li>Blogging in Markdown: I outline, draft, and format everything in Markdown.</li>
			<li>Tags &amp; Workspaces: I keep all my shit organized with tags and workspaces, so I never lose anything important.</li>
			<li>Information Dump: It’s a brain dump with an awesome search, making it my information repository.</li>
			<li>Actions: I’ve set up actions that let me do almost anything with my text. Send it to apps, email it, save it to a file, format it, you name it.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Drafts is more than just another app—it’s my go-to. Once you start using it, you’ll wonder how the fuck you ever got by without it. Trust me. Give the free version a go. You’ll be hooked. And no, Agile Tortoise isn’t paying me for this. I just fucking love the app.</p>
