        <p>Hey friends, I haven’t written much this week because I’ve been involved in building my static website. I’m excited to say that it’s now up and running!</p>
		<p>The process has been both challenging and enjoyable. Learning enough basic HTML and CSS to complete the project was the most demanding part. I watched several YouTube tutorials to get started, and found this one particularly helpful: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-html-beginners-course/">Learn HTML – Beginner’s Course</a>. ChatGPT was also a great resource for clarifying concepts I struggled to understand.</p>
		<p>Another tricky aspect was setting up an RSS feed. With the help of some YouTube videos and ChatGPT, I managed to get one working.</p>
		<p>Overall, it’s been a rewarding experience, and I learned a hell of a lot.</p>
