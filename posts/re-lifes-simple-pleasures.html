        <p>Lou Plummer, <a href="https://louplummer.lol/life-s-simple-pleasures/">writing about one of life&#8217;s simple pleasures</a>, said, &#8220;Give me a styrofoam tray of authentic tacos from a trailer in a convenience store parking lot selling authentic Mexican street food, and I will be happy.&#8221; This made me realize how much I miss good Mexican food. My favorite meal: two cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. When I lived in Southern California, I knew all the best spots for excellent Mexican food. Seven years ago, we moved to New Jersey, and I&#8217;m still searching for a place that serves real, authentic Mexican food.</p>
