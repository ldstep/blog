        <p>Right now, I’m using an iPhone 11, an M1 MacBook Air, and an M2 iPad Air. None of them are the pro, though I did pick up an iPhone 15 Pro Max recently. Honestly, the only reason I went for the Pro Max was the bigger screen it wasn't for the "pro" features at all.</p>
        <p>I still use some so-called pro apps on my Mac like Alfred, Keyboard Maestro, PopClip, Hazel, etc. But the truth is, I've been spending more time on my iPad, and those apps don’t even come into play there.</p>
        <p>I'm just not a pro user anymore—and that's okay!</p>
