        <p>One of my favorite things is my morning walks with my dog Trixie and listening to a podcast. We walk every morning rain, snow, wind, or freezing temperatures. We live in such a wonderful place. Our walks are usually about two miles. We walk out our long driveway to the road. The first thing we see is the farm across the street. Then, we turn left and walk to the neighborhood where everyone knows us, down to the main road, and then back up the long road to home, where everyone waves as they drive by. This has been a morning routine for going on 7 years.</p>
