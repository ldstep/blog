        <h1>Changing my task manager</h1>
        <div class="post-meta">Posted on August 7, 2024 by Loren</div>
        <p>Hey friends, I’ve been using <a href='https://culturedcode.com/things/'>Things 3</a> since it was released in 2017. With the anticipation of Things 4, I decided to spend some time yesterday and today adding all my tasks to <a href='https://goodtaskapp.com'>GoodTask</a>.</p>
		<p>Sooner or later Things 4 is going to roll out and when it does I won’t be updating. It’s too expensive, and there are more affordable options that meet my simple needs. So I figured now is as good a time as any to switch to Goodtask.</p>
		<p>For those not familiar, GoodTask is a task manager app that integrates with Apple’s Reminders and Calendar. It offers smart lists, themes, and custom quick actions. It supports recurring tasks, tags, and detailed filtering. GoodTask does everything I need from a task manager and more than what Reminders offers.</p>
